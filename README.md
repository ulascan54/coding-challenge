## Introduction

This repository is created for practicing algorithms and data structures. Each folder corresponds to a specific problem solved on a particular platform and includes both the solution code and a description of the problem.

## Usage

To run the codes:

1. Locate the relevant folder.
2. Check the problem name.
3. You can visit the site where the problem is located (you can directly click on the problem name) and paste the code to run it.
